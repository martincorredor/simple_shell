.SH NAME
.PP
.B Simple Shell - command languaje interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Simple Shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell is a mini version of a command language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input. This mini version is limited to certain built-in shell functions found in the environmental variable
.I PATH.
This simple version of shell does not yet handle pipes, redirects, variable expansion or more additional functions.
.SS Invocation
.I Interactive
Simple Shell can be invoked interactively by typing ./hsh in the user's normal Shell terminal.
.I Non-interactive
Simple Shell can be invoked non-interactively via pipeline typing (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh) in the user's normal Shell terminal.
.SS Commands Executions Process
.sp
If the command name does not contain slashes, the shell tries to locate it. If there is a shell function with that name, that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell looks for it in the shell's internals list. If a match is found, that embedded is invoked.
.sp
If the name is not a shell function or a built-in function, and does not contain slashes, the simple shell looks in the PATH environment variable for the executable file that matches the name. If the search is unsuccessful, the simple shell prints an error message "Error: File or description not found."

.I [[flags]...[arguments]]
